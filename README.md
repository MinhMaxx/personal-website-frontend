# My Personal Website (Frontend)

## Project Description

This is the frontend part of my personal website, designed to showcase my skills, experiences, projects, and achievements. Built using React, it features several sections including Home, About Me, Projects, Testimonials, and Contact. It interacts with a backend service to provide functionalities like testimonials and contact forms, using libraries such as React-Bootstrap for styling and Axios for HTTP requests.
